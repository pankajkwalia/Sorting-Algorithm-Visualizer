# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a Python program designed to visually demonstrate the workings of various sorting algorithms through interactive animations. It utilizes Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Matplotlib for generating animated visualizations of sorting processes.

## Key Features
- It is a GUI-based application to visualize various sorting algorithms using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter and Matplotlib libraries.
- Visualization : Created animated visualizations for each sorting algorithm. Used Matplotlib to update and display sorting
steps dynamically. Enabled real-time tracking of operations and elapsed time.
- GUI Development : Built an interactive interface with Tkinter. Allowed users to select sorting algorithms and animation
speed. Implemented user-friendly controls for starting and customizing visualizations.
- Technologies Used : Python, Tkinter, Matplotlib and NumPy
